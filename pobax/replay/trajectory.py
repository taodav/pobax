    """Makes a trajectory buffer.

    Args:
        add_batch_size: Batch size of experience added to the buffer. Used to initialise the leading
            axis of the buffer state's experience.
        sample_batch_size: Batch size of experience returned from the `sample` method of the
            buffer.
        sample_sequence_length: Trajectory length of experience of sampled batches. Note that this
            may differ from the trajectory length of experience added to the buffer.
        period: The period refers to the interval between sampled sequences. It serves to regulate
            how much overlap there is between the trajectories that are sampled. To understand the
            degree of overlap, you can calculate it as the difference between the
            sample_sequence_length and the period. For instance, if you set period=1, it means that
            trajectories will be sampled uniformly with the potential for any degree of overlap. On
            the other hand, if period is equal to sample_sequence_length - 1, then trajectories can
            be sampled in a way where only the first and last timesteps overlap with each other.
            This helps you control the extent of overlap between consecutive sequences in your
            sampling process.
        min_length_time_axis: Minimum length of the buffer (along the time axis) before sampling is
            allowed.
        max_size: Optional argument to specify the size of the buffer based on timesteps.
            This sets the maximum number of timesteps that can be stored in the buffer and sets
            the `max_length_time_axis` to be `max_size`//`add_batch_size`. This allows one to
            control exactly how many timesteps are stored in the buffer. Note that this
            overrides the `max_length_time_axis` argument.
        max_length_time_axis: Optional Argument to specify the maximum length of the buffer in terms
            of time steps within the 'time axis'. The second axis (the time axis) of the buffer
            state's experience field will be of size `max_length_time_axis`.
